# Configuring Agents

Once an agent is added to the platform, you can configure various aspects of the agent. Each agent type has specific configurations, as outlined below.

![Enter image alt description](Images/r9S_Image_13.png)

### Agent Overview

- All agents, regardless of type, share the same configuration sections: **Model**, **Transcriber**, **Voice**, and **Files and Chat Integration**.

- **Transcriber**: Set up transcription options for handling voice inputs.

- **Voice**: Configure the voice settings for the agent.

- **Files**: Manage and upload files for use with the agent.

- **Chat Integration**: Manage Chat Bot

### Files Section

The **Files** section allows you to upload and manage files that the agent can access during interactions:

- You can upload up to 4 files, each no larger than 20MB. Only PDF format is supported.

- **Enable RAG**: Turn on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to allow the agent to retrieve information from the uploaded files.

### Chat Integration

The **Chat Integration** tab provides three sections for configuring how the bot interacts with end users and how it is displayed on websites.

### 1. Bot Integration

This section contains the instructions needed to integrate the bot into the user's website. Typically, this involves generating code snippets (such as JavaScript) that can be embedded directly into the website's HTML to enable the chatbot interface.

- Follow the on-screen instructions to add the bot to your website.

- Ensure you place the code in the correct location (e.g., the `<head>` or `<body>` section of your HTML) as specified.

### 2. Data Collections

This section allows you to configure how the bot will collect data from end users. The options here define what information the bot should request from users and how the collected data will be processed.

- **Data Fields**: Specify the fields the bot should collect (e.g., name, email, feedback).

- **Validation Rules**: Set rules to ensure valid data is collected (e.g., valid email format).

### 2. Data Collections

The **Data Collections** section allows you to create and customize forms that the bot will use to collect data from end users. You can define different types of fields, each with its own specific behavior and rules.

#### Available Field Types

You can include the following types of fields in the form:

- **Text**: A standard single-line input where users can enter text.

- **Textarea**: A multi-line input for longer text responses.

- **Number**: A field where users can input numbers.

- **Select**: A dropdown menu where the user selects one option from a list.

- **Multiselect**: A dropdown menu where users can select multiple options from a list.

- **Email**: A field where users enter their email address.

- **Telephone**: A field for inputting a phone number.

- **Date**: A field for selecting a date from a calendar.

#### Common Features of All Fields

All fields come with these common settings:

- **Name**: A label that identifies the field (e.g., "Full Name" or "Email").

- **Enabled**: If a field is marked as "enabled," it will be visible to the user. If not, the field can be hidden, such as after form submission or when it's no longer needed.

- **Required**: If a field is "required," users must fill it in before they can submit the form. If it’s not required, they can skip the field.

Each field type may have additional configurations:

1. **Text and Textarea Fields**:

- You can set a limit on the number of characters the user is allowed to input. For example, a text field can be limited to a maximum of 100 characters.

- **Number Fields**:

- You can specify a minimum and a maximum value that the user can enter. For example, if the field is for age, you can set the minimum to 18 and the maximum to 65.

- **Select and Multiselect Fields**:

- These fields let users choose from a list of predefined options. For example, you could ask, "What is your favourite fruit?" and provide options like "Apple," "Banana," or "Orange."

- For **multiselect**, the user can choose more than one option if needed.

- It's important to have at least two options for users to choose from in select or multi select fields.

By using these settings, you can create a custom form that gathers exactly the information you need from your users, while ensuring the data is valid and useful.

### 3. Bot Customisation

This section provides options for customising the appearance of the bot on your website. The available fields include:

- **Agent Image**: Upload a custom image for your bot, which will be displayed in the chat interface (e.g., a logo or avatar).

- **Background and Text Colour**: Choose the colour of the chat window to match your brand or website.

- **Bot Width and Height**: Define the width and height of the chatbot interface if needed and it must be valid CSS value.

These customizations allow you to ensure the bot's user interface is consistent with your website’s design and brand identity.

### Outbound call

Users can make an outbound call to the end user.

### Talk with Agent

Will redirect the user to the chatbot page where the user can interact with the agent.

## Campaigns

The **Campaign** section allows users to create and manage campaigns that utilize phone number agents to make automated outbound calls. This feature is designed for scenarios where the agent needs to reach out to multiple end users.

### Adding Phone Numbers to the Campaign

After creating a campaign, the next step is to add phone numbers for the agent to call. You can do this in two ways:

### Starting a Campaign

Once the phone numbers have been added:

1. Verify that the phone numbers are correctly associated with the campaign.

2. Click the **Start Campaign** button to initiate the calling process.

- The selected agent will begin calling the listed phone numbers.

### Campaign Workflow

- The **Phone Number Agent** selected for the campaign will make outbound calls to the phone numbers that you’ve added.

- Calls can be scheduled or initiated in bulk using the campaign interface.

- You can monitor the status of the campaign from the dashboard.

![Enter image alt description](Images/HwQ_Image_15.png)

This allows for efficient and scalable calling operations, ideal for marketing campaigns, customer outreach, or automated notifications.
